## 🧠 What is this project

**FurionsWorkSystem** is a personal productivity and life-management system  
designed and built from scratch **not as an app for everyone**,  
but as a tool that I personally want to use every day.

It combines:
- work and projects
- daily planning
- discipline and habits
- long-term goals
- diary and reflections
- personal finances

All in one system.

## 🎯 Why this exists

Most tools I tried to organize my work and life were:
- inconvenient to use
- visually cluttered or unfocused
- hard to adapt to my own workflow
- impossible to extend or modify

I constantly had to jump between different apps for tasks, notes, goals and finances.

This project was born from a simple idea:

> **I want one system that I understand completely and can evolve myself.**
