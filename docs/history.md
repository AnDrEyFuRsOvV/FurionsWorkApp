# Project History

← [Back to README](../README.md)

The idea for **FurionsWorkSystem** did not start as a technical challenge.
It started as a personal question:

**What project should I add to my portfolio that would actually mean something?**

At first, I considered building different websites of varying complexity.
However, over time, after starting my job and working on many real projects,
my portfolio naturally filled with solid cases, and the need to create
“something just for the portfolio” slowly disappeared.

## From portfolio projects to personal needs

As I continued working, new ideas kept appearing.

I thought about building:
- a personal website where all information about me could live in one place
- a system where I could manage my portfolio through an admin panel
- a space to write posts and reflections
- small websites for local clients (for example, my mother needed a website)
- personal side projects alongside my main job

At some point, I realized that I was managing:
- work tasks
- personal projects
- ideas
- habits
- goals
- finances
- diary notes

All of this was scattered across different tools.

## The problem with existing tools

I tried many existing solutions:
- Notion
- built-in todo apps (Windows, macOS, mobile)
- kanban boards
- habit trackers
- finance apps

Some were paid.
Some were free.
None of them felt right.

The main problems were:
- too complex or overloaded
- visually uncomfortable
- hard to adapt to my own workflow
- impossible to fully control or extend
- everything lived in separate systems

I wanted one place.
One system.
Built exactly the way I think.

## The decision to build my own system

At that point, the idea became clear:

> **Instead of adapting myself to existing tools,  
> I will build my own system.**

A system that combines:
- work and projects (todo + kanban)
- habits and discipline
- long-term goals
- daily reflections and diary
- personal finances

All in one calm, understandable and controllable environment.

The goal was not to chase productivity,
but to create clarity and structure.

## How the project started

I shared this idea with a beginner designer I knew,
so that both of us could work on something meaningful.
He could practice design,
and I could shape the system logic and structure.

That is how **FurionsWorkSystem** was born.

How the project evolves can be followed in my personal blog
and portfolio website.
